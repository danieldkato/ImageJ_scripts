// OVERVIEW:
// Use this macro to rename every ROI open in ROI manager according to its numeric
// index. An ROI's numeric index is the number displayed within its boundaries when 
// overlaid on an image (indices are assigned by ImageJ according to the order in 
// which the ROIs are added to ROI manager).This is useful because it ensures that
// the number displayed in every ROI matches its name in ROI manager, in case it
// to be selected for editing, etc.       


// REQUREIMENTS:
// This macro assumes that ROI manager is already open and the ROIs to be renamed
// have been loaded.
